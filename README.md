# Copperspice-examples
This project will consist of a number of small projects that use the Copperspice library.

Copperspice is a fork of the Open Source version of Qt, https://www.copperspice.com/


This project will also include sample code derived from VoidRealms, a youtube and facebook group founded by Bryan Cairns.

I highly recomend Voidrealms as an intro to Qt programming.
