# Copperspice-examples



This project will:
- consist of a number of small projects that use the Copperspice library.
- have an active [Wiki page](https://github.com/ShamanTcler/Copperspice-examples/wiki)


Copperspice is a fork of the Open Source version of Qt, https://www.copperspice.com/

One of the objectives of this project is to show the migration of traditional Qt code to Copperspice. Rather than invent all new examples we will leverage pre-existing code from a number of sources.

One such source is "Voidrealms", YouTube and facebook group founded by Bryan Cairns.

I highly recommend Voidrealms as an intro to Qt programming.
